Lime and limpid green, a second scene+A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds+Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.+Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Blinding signs flap,+Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.+Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lucifer Sam, siam cat.+Always sitting by your side+Always by your side.+That cat's something I can't explain.
Ginger, ginger, Jennifer Gentle you're a witch.+You're the left side+He's the right side.+Oh, no!+That cat's something I can't explain.
Lucifer go to sea.+Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.+Somewhere, anywhere.+That cat's something I can't explain.
At night prowling sifting sand.+Hiding around on the ground.+He'll be found when you're around.+That cat's something I can't explain.
There was a king who ruled the land+His majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle+Showers silver on the people
Oh Mother, tell me more+Why'd'ya have to leave me there+Hanging in my infant air+Waiting?
You only have to read the lines+They're scribbly black and everything shines
Across the stream with wooden shoes+With bells to tell the king the news+A thousand misty riders climb up+Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming+The words have different meaning+Yes they did
For all the time spent in that room+The doll's house, darkness, old perfume+And fairy stories held me high on+Clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother, tell me more+Tell me more+Aaaaaaaah+Aaaaaaaah+Aaaaaaaah
Alone in the clouds all blue+Lying on an eiderdown.
Yippee! You can't see me+But I can you.
Lazing in the foggy dew+Sitting on a unicorn.
No fair, you can't hear me+But I can you.
Watching buttercups cup the light+Sleeping on a dandelion.
Too much, I won't touch you+But then I might.
Screaming through the starlit sky+Traveling by telephone.
Hey ho, here we go+Ever so high.
Doctor doctor!+I'm in bed+Achin' head+Gold is lead+Choke on bread+Underfed+Gold is lead+Jesus bled+Pain is red+Are goon+Grow go+Greasy spoon+You swoon+June bloom
Music seems to help the pain+Seems to cultivate the brain.
Doctor kindly tell your wife that+I'm alive - flowers thrive - realize - realize+Realize.
I want to tell you a story+About a little man+If I can.+A gnome named Grimble Grumble.+And little gnomes stay in their homes.+Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.
He wore a scarlet tunic,+A blue green hood,+It looked quite good.
He had a big adventure+Amidst the grass+Fresh air at last.
Wining, dining, biding his time.+And then one day - hooray!+Another way for gnomes to say+Hoooooooooray.
Look at the sky, look at the river+Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go.+And then one day - hooray!+Another way for gnomes to say+Hoooooooooray.+Hooooooooooooooray.
A movement is accomplished in six stages+And the seventh brings return.
The seven is the number of the young light+It forms when darkness is increased by one.
Change returns success+Going and coming without error. Action brings good fortune.+Sunset.
The time is with the month of winter solstice+When the change is due to come.
Thunder in the other course of heaven.+Things cannot be destroyed once and for all.
The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows+Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere.+He didn't care.
His head did no thinking+His arms didn't move except then the wind cut up+Rough and mice ran around on the ground+He stood in a field where barley grows.
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me+But now he's resigned to his fate+'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind.
I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.+It's got a basket, a bell that rings and+Things to make it look good.
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.+I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.
I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.+There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.+I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.
I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.+I don't know why. I call him Gerald.+He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.
I've got a clan of gingerbread men.+Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.+Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.
I know a room of musical tunes.+Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork.+Let's go into the other room and make them work.
Far, far, far away - way+People heard him say - say+I will find a way - way+There will come a day - day
Something will be done+Then at last the mighty ship+Descending on a point of flame+Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall
Now, now, now is the time - time+Time to be - be - be aware
Carter's father saw it there+And knew the Rhull revealed to him+The living soul of Hereward the Wake
Oh, my, something in my eye - eye+Something in the sky - sky
Waiting there for me+The outer lock rolled slowly back
The servicemen were heard to sigh+For there revealed in flowing robes+Was Lucy in the sky
Oh - oh - did you ever?+No No never ever will they+I'll say!
Summoning his cosmic powers+And glowing slightly from his toes+His psychic emanations flowed
Remember a day before today+A day when you were young
Free to play along with time+Evening never comes
Sing a song that can't be sung+Without the morning's kiss
Queen you shall be if you wish+Look for your king
Why can't we play today?+Why can't we stay that way?
Climb your favorite apple tree+Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun+Dream yourself away
Why can't we reach the sun?+Why can't we blow the years away?
Blow away+Blow away+Remember+Remember
Little by little the night turns around+Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotus's lean on each other in yearning+Over the hills a swallow is resting
Over the mountain watching the watcher+Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
Knowledge of love is knowledge of shadow+Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
Set the controls for the heart of the sun+The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
Witness the man who waves at the wall+Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening+Will he remember the lesson of giving?
Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg+He won it in the war, in 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too+In orange, red and blue+He found it in the zoo
Dear oh dear, oh are they really sad for me?+Dear oh dear, oh will they really laugh at me?
Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him+Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?
Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain+He's never been the same+No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream+From Her Majesty, the Queen+His boots were very clean
Marigolds are very much in love+But he doesn't mind+Picking up his sister
He makes his way in to the see-saw land+All the way she smiles+She goes up while he goes down, down
Sits on a stick in the river+Laughter in his sleep+Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit+He doesn't know, so then+She goes up while he goes down, down
Another time, another day+A brother's way to leave
She'll be selling plastic flowers on a+Sunday afternoon+Picking up weeds+She hasn't got time to care+All can see he's not there+She grows up for another man, and he's down
It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here+And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear+That I'm not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big+And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes+And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song+I don't care if the sun don't shine+And I don't care if nothing is mine+And I don't care if I'm nervous with you+I'll do my loving in the winter
And the sea isn't green+And I love the Queen+And what exactly is a dream+And what exactly is a joke
In a churchyard by a river+Lazing in the haze of midday+Laughing in the grasses+And the graves
Yellow bird, you are not long+In singing and in flying on+In laughing and in leaving
Willow weeping in the water+Waving to the river daughters+Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor+Saw a crater in the Sun+A thousand miles of moonlight later
I was standing by the Nile+When I saw the lady smile+I would take her out for a while+For a while
Like tears wept like a child+How her golden hair was blowing wild+Then she spread her wings to fly+For to fly
Soaring high above the breezes+Going always where she pleases+She will make it to the island+In the sun
I will follow in her shadow+And I'll watch her from my window+One day I will catch her
She is calling from the deep+Summoning my soul to endless sleep+She is bound to drag me down+Drag me down
We smile and smile+We smile and smile+Laughter echoes in your eyes
We climb and climb+We climb and climb+Foot falls softly in the pines
We cry and cry+We cry and cry+Sadness passes in a while
We roll and roll+We roll and roll+Help me roll away the stone
Heavy hung the canopy of blue+Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines+Through the dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of the wave+Hazy were the visions overplayed
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine+Made her blind everytime
Green is the colour of her kind+Quickness of the eye+Deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between+The hopefull and the damned
The path you tread is narrow+And the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching+From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping+Like a tube train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end+Will the final cuplet rhyme
And it's high time Cymbaline+It's high time Cymbaline+Please wake me
A butterfly with broken wings+Is falling by your side+The ravens all are closing in+There's nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent+Are both busy on the phone+Selling colored photographs+To magazines back home
The lines converging where you stand+They must have moved the picture plain+The leaves are heavy round your feet+You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you+That they're moving into range+And Doctor Strange is always changing size
I'm so afraid+Of mistakes that I've made+Shaking every time that I awake
I feel like a cardboard cut-out man+So build me a time+When the characters rhyme+And the story line is kind
I've aged and aged since the first page+I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down+From the shelf above your head+And build me a time +When the characters rhyme+And the story line is kind
I live where I'm left+On the shelf like the rest+And the epilogue reads like a sad song
Please pick up your camera+And use me again+And build me a time +When the characters rhyme+And the storyline is kind
Bath of tequila, Manuel+Listen Gringo
Laugh at my lisp and I kill you+I think
This Spanish music+It sets my soul on fire
Lovely seniorita+Your eyes are like stars+Your teeth are like pearls+Your ruby lips seniorita
Down, down. Down, down. The star is screaming.+Beneath the lies. Lie, lie. Tschay, tschay, tschay.
Careful, careful, careful with that axe, Eugene.
The stars are screaming loud.+Tsch.+Tsch.+Tsch.
Icy wind of night, be gome.+This is not your domain.
In the sky a bird was heard to cry.
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds+Belied a deathly silence that lay all around.+Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.+And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,+Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.
In the lazy water meadow+I lay me down.
All around me,+Golden sunflakes settle on the ground,+Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,+Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.
Aye an' a bit of Mackeral settler rack and ruin+ran it doon by the haim, 'ma place+well I slapped me and I slapped it doon in the side+and I cried, cried, cried.
The fear a fallen down taken never back the raize and then Craig Marion,+get out wi' ye Claymore out mi pocket a' ran doon, doon the middin stain+picking the fiery horde that was fallen around ma feet.
Never he cried, never shall it ye get me alive+ye rotten hound of the burnie crew. Well I snatched fer the blade O my+Claymore cut and thrust and I fell doon before him round his feet.
Aye! A roar he cried frae the bottom of his heart that I would nay fall+but as dead, dead as 'a can be by his feet; de ya ken?
And the wind cried Mary.+Thank you.
Following the path as it leads towards the Darkness in the North+Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy+They've seen that hope before
And if you want to stay for a little bit+Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you the night is beckoning+And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you+But you can't touch the restless sky
Close your aching eyes beyond your name
Mist is swelling, creatures crawling,+Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own+But the force behind can't conquer all your fears
Throw your thoughts back many years+To the time when there was life in every morning
Perhaps a day will come+When the nights will be as on that morning
Rest your weary head, be on your way.
If I were a swan, I'd be gone.
If I were a train, I'd be late.
And if I were a good man, I'd talk with you more often than I do.
If I were to sleep, I could dream.
If I were afraid, I could hide.
If I go insane, please don't put your wires in my brain.
If I were the moon, I'd be cool.
If I were a rule, I would bend.
If I were a good man, I'd understand the spaces between friends.
If I were alone, I would cry.
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry.
And if I go insane, will you still let me join in with the game?
If I were a good man, I'd talk to you more often than I do.
Would you like to say something before you leave?+Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you+I shouldn't care at all+We met just six hours ago+The music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year
And I would like to know, how do you feel?+How do you feel?+How do you feel, how do you feel?
Not a single word was said+The night still hid our fears+Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon - in a room of ninety five
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you+Have you time before you leave to greet another man?
Goodbye to you+Charlotte Pringle's due+I've had enough for one day
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,+Summer evening birds are calling.
Summer's thunder time of year,+The sound of music in my ears.
Distant bells,+New mown grass smells so sweet.
By the river holding hands,+Roll me up and lay me down.
And if you sit,+Don't make a sound.
Pick your feet up off the ground.
And if you hear as the warm night falls+The silver sound from a time so strange,+Sing to me, sing to me.
Children's laughter in my ears,+The last sunlight disappears.
One of these days +I'm going to cut you into little pieces
A cloud of eiderdown+Draws around me softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie+With my love by my side
And she's breathing low+And the candle dies
When night comes down you lock the door+The boot falls to the floor
As darkness falls the waves roll by+The seasons change+The wind is warm
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan+Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields+A cold rain is falling+In a golden dawn
And deep beneath the ground+The early morning sounds and I go down
And I rise like a bird+In the haze and the first rays touch the sky+And the night winds die
You say the hill's too steep to climb+Chiding
You say you'd like to see me try+Climbing
You pick the place and I'll choose the time
And I'll climb the hill in my own way+Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above+The tree-line and the clouds+I look down+Hear the sound+Of the things you said today
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd+Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round+Frowning
And who's the fool who wears the crown
Go down in your own way+And everyday is the right day
And as you rise above+The fear-lines in his brow+You look down+Hear the sound+Of the faces in the crowd
As I reach for a peach+Slide a rind down behind+the sofa in San Tropez
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand+Riding a wave in the wake of an old Sedan
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness+Scratched by the sand that fell from our love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling+If you're alone I'll come home
Backwards and home bound +The pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
Owning a home with no silver spoon+I'm drinking champagne like a big tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather+I'll gather my far flung thoughts together
Speeding away on a wind to a new day+If your alone I'll come home
And I pause for a while+By a country style+And listen to things they say
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea+I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone+if you're alone I'll come home
I was in the kitchen+Seamus, that's the dog was outside
Well, I was in the kitchen+Seamus, my old hound was outside
Well, you know the sun was sinking slowly+But my hound just sat right down and cried
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide+Comes willowing across the sand+And everything is green and submarine
And no one showed us to the land+And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries+And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street+By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand+And lead you through the land+And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on+And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks+And no one tries+No one flies around the sun
Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes+Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall+Come streaming in on sunlight wings+A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies+And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide+And call to you across the sky.
Bridges burning gladly,+Merging with the shadows,+Flickering between the lines.
Stolen moments floating softly on the air,+Born on wings of fire and climbing higher.
Ancient bonds are breaking,+Moving on and changing sides.
Dreaming of a new day,+Cast aside the other way.
Magic visions stirring,+Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes.
The door stands ajar,+The wall that once were high.
Beyond the gilded cage,+Beyond the reach of ties.
The moment is at hand.
She breaks the golden band.
Come on, my friends,+Let's make for the hills.
They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills.
You can get your hands on whatever we find,+Because I'm only coming along for the ride.
Well, you go your way,+I'll go mine.
I don't care if we get there on time.
Everybody's searching for something, they say.+I'll get my kicks on the way.
Over mountains, across seas,+Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names.+Faces of people and places don't change.
All I have to do is just close my eyes+To see the seagulls wheeling on those far distant skies.
All I want to tell you,+All I want to say is count me in on the journey.+Don't expect me to stay.
Heaven sent the promised land+Looks allright from where I stand+Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step+Show me where the key is kept+Point me down the right line because it's time
So let me in from the cold+Turn my lead into gold
Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul+And I think I'm growing old
Flash the readies wots...uh the deal+Got to make to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel.
Mile after mile+Stone after stone+Turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home you're on your own
Fire bright by candlelight+With her by my side
And if she prefers we will never stir again
Someone sent the promised land+And I grabbed it with both hands+Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout 'come on in, what's the news and where you been?'
Cause there's no wind left in my soul+And I've grown old
You shout in your sleep+Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest if once put to the test?
You awake with a start to just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky+Just two ears, just two eyes
You set sail across the sea of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end+Your fantasies merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist+You find your eyes are growing moist
All the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice
Who are you and who am I to say we know the reason why?
Some are born+Some men die beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war, there'll be peace+But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust+All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend+So this song will end
One two three four!
The memories of a man in his old age+Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You shuffle in the gloom of the sickroom+And talk to yourself as you die.
Life is a short warm moment+And death is a long cold rest.
You get your chance to try+In the twinkling of an eye:+Eighty years, with luck, or even less.
So all aboard for the American tour,+And maybe you'll make it to the top.
But mind how you go.+I can tell you, 'cause I know.
You may find it hard to get off.
You are the angel of death+And I am the dead man's son.
He was buried like a mole in a fox hole.
And everyone is still on the run.
And who is the master of fox hounds?+And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?+And who beats the funeral drum?
Stay+And help me to end the day.
And if you don't mind+We'll break a bottle of wine.
Stick around+And maybe we'll put one down
'Cause I wanna find+What lies behind those eyes.
Midnight blue burning gold.+A yellow moon is growing cold.
I rise+Looking through my morning eyes,+Surprised+To find you by my side.
Rack my brain+To try to remember your name+To find+The words to tell you goodbye.
Morning dues.+Newborn day.+Midnight blue+Turn to gray.
I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands...
I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad...
Breathe, breathe in the air+Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me+Look around and choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly+And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see+Is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit, run+Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done+Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly+But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave+You race toward an early grave.
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day+Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town+Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain+You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you+No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking+Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older+Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time+Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way+The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
Home, home again+I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired+It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field+The tolling of the iron bell+Calls the faithful to their knees+To hear the softly spoken magic spell
And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind.
Why should I be frightened of dying?+There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime.
I never said I was frightened of dying.
Money, get away+Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas+Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,+Think I'll buy me a football team
Money, get back+I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit+Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set+And I think I need a Learjet
Money, it's a crime+Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say+Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away
Ha-ha! I was in the right!+Yes, absolutely in the right!+I certainly was in the right!
Yeah, I was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!
Why does anyone do anything?+Why does anyone do anything?
I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!
I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out.
Us and them+And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you+God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
'Forward!' he cried+From the rear+And the front rank died
And the general sat+And the lines on the map+Moved from side to side
Black and blue+And who knows which is which and who is who?
Up and down+And in the end it's only round and round and round
Haven't you heard+It's a battle of words?+The poster bearer cried.
Listen, son,+Said the man with the gun,+There's room for you inside.
Well, I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again.
Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I could've given him a thrashin' but I only hit him once.
It's only the difference between right and wrong, innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they? Eh?
Down and out+It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without+And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way+It's a busy day+I've got things on my mind
For want of the price+Of tea and a slice+The old man died
The lunatic is on the grass+The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs+Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall+The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor+And every day the paper boy brings more
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon+And if there is no room upon the hill+And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too+I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
The lunatic is in my head+The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change+You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door and throw away the key+There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear+You shout and no one seems to hear+And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes+I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
I can't think of anything to say except...+I think it's marvelous! Ha, ha, ha!
All that you touch+And all that you see+All that you taste+All you feel+And all that you love+And all that you hate+All you distrust+All you save+And all that you give+And all that you deal+And all that you buy,+Beg, borrow or steal
And all you create+And all you destroy+And all that you do+And all that you say+And all that you eat+And everyone you meet+And all that you slight+And everyone you fight+And all that is now+And all that is gone+And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune+But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.
There is no dark side of the moon, really.+Matter of fact, it's all dark.
Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.+Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.+Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.+Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.+Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,+provided with toys and Scouting for Boys.
You bought a guitar to punish your ma,+And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine.
What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream.
You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar.
Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far.
You're gonna fly high,+You're never gonna die,+You're gonna make it if you try,+They're gonna love you.
Well, I've always had a deep respect,+And I mean that most sincerely.
Your band is just fantastic, That is really what I think.
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?+We call it Riding the Gravy Train.
We're just knocked out.+We heard about the sell out.
You gotta get an album out,+You owe it to the people.+We're so happy we can hardly count.
Everybody else is just green
Have you seen the chart?+It's a hell of a start,+It could be made into a monster+If we all pull together as a team.
So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?+A smile from a veil?+Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?+Hot ashes for trees?+Hot air for a cool breeze?+Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,+Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?+The same old fears.+Wish you were here.
Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far.+Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there.+Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,+sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,+come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!
If you didn't care what happened to me,+And I didn't care for you
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain+Occasionally glancing up through the rain+Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing.
You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight+You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking.
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake+A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to+So that when they turn their backs on you+You'll get the chance to put the knife in!
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder+You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south+Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man+All alone and dying of cancer.
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone+Dragged down by the stone.
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused+Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending+That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner+And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.
Who was born in a house full of pain+Who was trained not to spit in the fan+Who was told what to do by the man+Who was broken by trained personnel+Who was fitted with collar and chain+Who was given a pat on the back+Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home+Who was ground down in the end+Who was found dead on the phone+Who was dragged down by the stone.
Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel, ha ha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart+You're nearly a good laugh+Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin+Saying keep on digging+Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find?+When you're down in the pig mine
You're nearly a laugh+You're nearly a laugh+But you're really a cry.
Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag, ha ha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh+Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel+You're hot stuff with a hat pin+And good fun with a hand gun
Hey you Whitehouse, ha ha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse, ha ha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat+All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You gotta stem the evil tide+And keep it all on the inside
Mary you're nearly a treat+Mary you're nearly a treat+But you're really a cry.
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out+There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan and I have seen+Things are not what they seem
What do you get for pretending the danger's not real?
Meek and obedient you follow the leader+Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise+A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem+No, this is no bad dream
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want+He makes me down to lie+Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by+With bright knives he releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places+He converteth me to lamb cutlets+For lo, he hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones+Through quiet reflection and great dedication+Master the art of karate+Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers+March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
Have you heard the news?+The dogs are dead!
You better stay home+And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old
You know that I care what happens to you+And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone+Or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe+To bury my bones
And any fool knows a dog needs a home+A shelter from pigs on the wing
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show+To feel the warm thrill of confusion+That space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?+Is this not what you expected to see?
If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes+You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise
Momma loves her baby+And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe+And the sky may look blue
Ooh, babe+Ooh, baby blue+Ooh, babe
If you should go skating+On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach+Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised,+When a crack in the ice+Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind+With your fear flowing out behind you+As you claw the thin ice
Daddy's flown across the ocean+Leaving just a memory
A snap shot in the family album+Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall+All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddy!
When we grew up and went to school+There were certain teachers who+Would hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision+Upon anything we did+Exposing every weakness+However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known+When they got home at night,+Their fat and psychopathic wives+Would thrash them within inches of their lives
We don't need no education+We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom+Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone
All in all it's just another brick in the wall+All in all you're just another brick in the wall
Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!+How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!
You! Yes, you, behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy!
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, aah, mother, should I build the wall?
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh, aah, is it just a waste of time?
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry+Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true+Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you+Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing+She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm
Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe+Of course mama's gonna help build the wall
Mother, do you think she's good enough for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh, aah, mother, will she break my heart?
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry+Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you+Mama won't let anyone dirty get through+Mama's gonna wait up 'til you get in+Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe+You'll always be a baby to me
Mother, did it need to be so high?
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.
Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder+Why we had to run for shelter+When the promise of a brave new world+Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?
The flames are all long gone+But the pain lingers on
Goodbye blue sky+Goodbye blue sky+Goodbye+Goodbye
What shall we use+To fill the empty spaces+Where we used to talk?
How shall I fill+The final places?+How should I complete the wall?
I am just a new boy+A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times+Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman+Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl
Will some woman in this desert land +Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee+Oooh Babe set me free
Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?
What? This place is bigger than our apartment!
Can I get a drink of water?+You want some, huh?
Oh wow, look at this tub?+Wanna take a bath?
Hello?+Are you feeling okay?...
Day after day, love turns grey+Like the skin of a dying man
Night after night, we pretend it's all right+But I have grown older and+You have grown colder+And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade+Tight as a tourniquet+Dry as a funeral drum
Run to the bedroom+In the suitcase on the left+You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened+This is just a passing phase+One of my bad days
Would you like to watch T.V.?+Or get between the sheets? +Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?+Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you?+Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?+Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
Ooh babe+Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe+To put through the shredder+In front of my friends
How could you go+When you know how I need you?+To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
How can you treat me this way+Running away
Ooh babe+Why are you running away!?
I don't need no arms around me+And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall+Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall+All in all you were all just bricks in the wall
Hey, you!+Out there in the cold+Getting lonely, getting old.+Can you feel me?
Hey, you!+Standing in the aisles+With itchy feet and fading smiles.+Can you feel me?
Hey, you!+Don't help them to bury the light.+Don't give in without a fight.
Hey, you!+Out there on your own+Sitting naked by the phone.+Would you touch me?
Hey, you!+With your ear against the wall+Waiting for someone to call out.+Would you touch me?
Hey, you!+Would you help me to carry the stone?+Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy.+The wall was too high as you can see.
No matter how he tried he could not break free.+And the worms ate into his brain.
Hey, you!+Out there on the road,+Always doing what you're told.+Can you help me?
Hey, you!+Out there beyond the wall,+Breaking bottles in the hall.+Can you help me?
Hey, you!+Don't tell me there's no hope at all.
Together we stand,+Divided we fall.
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?+Is there anybody out there?+Is there anybody out there?+Is there anybody out there?
I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on+Got those swollen hand blues.
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light+And I've got second sight+Got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know+When I try to get through+On the telephone to you+There'll be nobody home
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm+And the inevitable pinhole burns+All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers+I've got a silver spoon on a chain+I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes+I've got a strong urge to fly+But I've got nowhere to fly to
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone+There's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohills boots+But I've got fading roots.
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that we would meet again+Some sunny day?
Vera! Vera!+What has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?
Bring the boys back home!
Don't leave the children on their own,+Bring the boys back home!
Hello,+Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.+Is there anyone at home?
Come on now+I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain+And get you on your feet again
Relax+I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts+Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding+A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves+Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever+My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again+I can't explain, you would not understand+This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
O.K.+Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!+But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?+I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show+Come on, it's time to go.
When I was a child+I caught a fleeting glimpse+Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone+I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown+The dream is gone
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa+Must the show go on?
Ooh Pa take me home+Ooh Ma let me go
There must be some mistake+I didn't mean to let them take away my soul+Am I too old? Is it too late?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa+Where has the feeling gone?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa+Will I remember the songs?
Ooh ah the show must go on.
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show+To feel the warm thrill of confusion+That space cadet glow
I got some bad news for you sunshine+Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band+We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the theatre tonight?+Get 'em up against the wall
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me+Get him up against the wall
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon+Who let all this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots+If I had my way I'd have all of ya shot
Run, run, run, run+Run, run, run, run+Run, run, run, run+Run, run, run, run
You better make your face up in+Your favourite disguise+With your button down lips and your+Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile+And your hungry heart+Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters+As the cockleshell shatters+And the hammers batter+Down your door
You better run all day+And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings+Deep inside. And if you're+Takin' your girlfriend+Out tonight+You better park the car+Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat+Trying to pick her locks+They're gonna send you back to mother+In a cardboard box
You better run
Eins, zwei, drei, alle
You cannot reach me now+No matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over+Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall+Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall+Waiting for the worms to come
Waiting to cut out the deadwood+Waiting to clean up the city+Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt+Waiting to weed out the weaklings+Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors
Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain+Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens+Waiting for the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews+Waiting to follow the worms
Would you like to see Britannia rule again,+My friend?+All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again,+My friend?+All you need to do is follow the worms.
All you need to do is follow the worms.
Stop!
I wanna go home+Take off this uniform+And leave the show
And I'm waiting in this cell+Because I have to know+Have I been guilty all this time
Good morning, the Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show+The prisoner who now stands before you+Was caught red-handed showing feelings+Showing feelings of an almost human nature+This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!
I always said he'd come to no good+In the end, your honour
If they'd let me have my way+I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied+The bleeding hearts and artists+Let him get away with murder+Let me hammer him today
Crazy+Toys in the attic,+I am crazy
Truly gone fishing+They must have taken my marbles away
Crazy+Toys in the attic+He is crazy
You little shit, you're in it now+I hope they throw away the key
You should've talked to me more often than you did,+But no, you had to go your own way.
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me alone
Babe+Come to mother, baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'Lord I never wanted him to get in any trouble+Why'd he ever have to leave me?+Worm your honour, let me take him home
Crazy+Over the rainbow+I am crazy+Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall+When I came in
Crazy+Over the rainbow+He is crazy
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible.+There's no need for the jury to retire.
In all my years of judging+I have never heard before+Of someone more deserving the full penalty of law.
The way you made them suffer—+Your exquisite wife and mother—+Fills me with the urge to defecate
Go on, judge. Shit on him!
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear+I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.
Tear down the wall!
All alone or in twos+The ones who really love you+Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand+And some gathered together in bands+The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand
And when they've given you their all+Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy+Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall
Isn't this where...+...we came in?
Tell me true, tell me why, was Jesus crucified?
Was it for this that Daddy died?+Was it for you? Was it me?+Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn’t for the Nips+Being so good at building ships+The yards would still be open on the Clyde
And it can’t be much fun for them+Beneath the rising sun+With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done, Maggie what have we done?+What have we done to England?
They flutter behind you your possible pasts+Some bright-eyed and crazy, some frightened and lost
A warning to anyone still in command+Ranks! Fire!
Of their possible future, to take care
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine+With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time
Do you remember me? How we used to be?+Do you think we should be closer?
She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile+Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their MACs+For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand+He said, “I was just a child then, now I’m only a man.”
By the cold and religious we were taken in hand+Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray+Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay
Strung out behind us the banners and flags+Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags
It was just before dawn one miserable+Morning in black Forty-Four
When the forward commander was told to sit tight+When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks as the other ranks+Held back the enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price+Of a few hundred ordinary lives
And kind old King George sent Mother a note+When he heard that Father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll+With gold leaf and all
And I found it one day+In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away+And my eyes still grow damp to remember+His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp
It was dark all around, there was frost in the ground+When the Tigers broke free
And no one survived+From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z
They were all left behind+Most of them dead, the rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command+Took my daddy from me
Jesus, Jesus, what’s it all about?
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape
When I was their age all the lights went out+There was no time to whine or mope about
And even now part of me flies over+Dresden at angels one five
Though they’ll never fathom it+Behind my sarcasm desperate memories lie
Sweetheart, sweetheart are you fast asleep?+Good ‘Cause that’s the only time that I can really speak to you
And there is something that I’ve locked away+A memory that is too painful+To withstand the light of day
When we came back from the war+The banners and flags hung on everyone’s door
We danced and we sang in the street and+The church bells rang
But the burning in my heart+The memory smolders on+Of the gunners dying words on the intercom...
Floating down, through the clouds+Memories come rushing up to meet me now
In the space between the heavens+And in the corner of some foreign field+I had a dream+I had a dream
Good-bye Max+Good-bye Ma
After the service, when you’re walking slowly to the car+And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air+You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel+And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band+You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream!
A place to stay+Enough to eat+Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud+About your doubts and fears+And what’s more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door+You can relax on both sides of the tracks+And maniacs don’t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control+And everyone has recourse to the law+And no-one kills the children anymore+And no one kills the children anymore
Night after night+Going round and round my brain+His dream is driving me insane
In the corner of some foreign field+The gunner sleeps tonight
What’s done is done+We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream+Take heed
Button your lip andon’t let the shield slip
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions+You can hide, hide, hide+Behind paranoid eyes
You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar+Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world+With the boys in the crowd
You hide, hide, hide+Behind petrified eyes
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory+Now you’re lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high+And you hide, hide, hide+Behind brown and mild eyes
Oi…Get your filthy hands off my desert!+What ‘e say?
Brezhnev took Afghanistan+Begin took Beirut+Galtieri took the Union Jack+And Maggie, over lunch one day+Took a cruiser with all hands+Apparently, to make him give it back
Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere+And build them a home, a little place of their own
The Fletcher Memorial Home+For Incurable Tyrants and Kings
And they can appear to themselves every day+On closed circuit T.V+To make sure they’re still real+It’s the only connection they feel
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Reagan and Haig
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisley
“Hello Maggie!”
Mr. Brezhnev and party+“Scusi dov’è il bar?”
The ghost of McCarthy,+The memories of Nixon.
Who’s the bald chap?
And now, adding colour+A group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,+And amuse themselves playing games for awhile
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you’re dead
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye+With their favourite toys+They’ll be good girls and boys
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial+Wasters of life and limb
Is everyone in?+Are you having a nice time?+Now the final solution can be applied
They disembarked in 45+And no-one spoke and no-one smiled+There were too many spaces in the line
Gathered at the cenotaph+All agreed with the hand on heart+To sheath the sacrificial Knifes
But now+She stands upon Southampton dock+With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings+To her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation knuckles+White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again
And still the dark stain spreads between+Their shoulder blades+A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over+We spent what they had made, but+In the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cut
Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes+I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies+I’m spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive+And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes+And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall+Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I’m in I’ll tell you what’s behind the wall
There’s a kid who had a big hallucination+Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you’re sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him+Or is it just a crazy dream?
And if I show you my dark side+Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you+And show you my weak side+What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?+Would you take the children away+And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance+As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?+Or would you take me home?
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings+Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands+Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang+I never had the nerve to make the final cut
Fuck all that, we've got to get on with these+Got to compete with the wily Japanese
There’s too many home fires burning and not enough trees+So fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
Can’t stop, lose job+Mind gone, silicon
Tsar bomb, what bomb?
Get away, pay day+Make hay, break down
Need fix, big six+Click, click
Hold on, oh no+Bingo!
Make them laugh, make them cry+Make them dance in the aisles
Make them pay, make them stay+Make them feel okay
Not now John, we've got to get on with the film show+Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
Who cares what it’s about as long as the kids go+So, not now John, we've gotta get on with the show
Hang on John I've got to get on with this+I don’t know what it is, but it fits on here like- tsss
Come at the end of the shift, we’ll go and get pissed+But now now John, I've gotta get on with this
Hold on John, I think there’s something good on+I used to read books but...
It could be the news, or some other amusement+Could be reusable shows
No need to worry about the Vietnamese+Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees+Well, maybe not the Russian Bear, maybe the Swedes
In my rear view mirror the sun is going down+Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things+That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions+Of the holocaust to come
The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in+Gives way and suddenly it’s day again
The sun is in the east+Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph+Could be the human race is run
Like the moment when the brakes lock+And you slide towards the big truck
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear+And you’ll never hear their voices+And you’ll never see their faces+You have no recourse to the law anymore
And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate+Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand+The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds, foe and friend+We were all equal in the end
Into the distance, a ribbon of black+Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field+Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast+How can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky+Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings+Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home+Unladened empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly+Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies+Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
Friction lock - set+Mixture - rich+Propellers - fully forward+Flaps - set - 10 degree+Engine gauges and suction - check+Mixture set to maximum percent - recheck
Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. Its gonna roll this time+Just hand the power gradually, and it
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer+My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly+Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light+Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this+Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Dogs of war and men of hate+With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned+Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale+Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive+Even our masters don't know+The webs we weave
One world, it's a battleground+One world, and we will smash it down+One world ... One world
Invisible transfers and long distance calls+Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar+Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun+Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least+And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
The dogs of war won't negotiate+The dogs of war don't capitulate
They will take and you will give+And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door+But wherever you go+You know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained+But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain
A restless eye across a weary room+A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end+No hint, no word her honour to defend
I will, I will she sighed to my request+And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire+I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence+I gave in to my decadence
One slip, and down the hole we fall+It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason+That binds a life for life+A small regret, you won't forget+There'll be no sleep in here tonight
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?+Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown+The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
One slip... one slip...
On the turning away+From the pale and downtrodden+And the words they say+Which we won't understand
Don't accept that what's happening+Is just a case of others' suffering+Or you'll find that you're joining in+The turning away
It's a sin that somehow+Light is changing to shadow+And casting its shroud+Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown+Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone+In the dream of the proud
On the wings of the night+As the daytime is stirring+Where the speechless unite+In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange+Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change+On the wings of the night
No more turning away+From the weak and the weary+No more turning away+From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share+It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be+No more turning away?
One sound, one single sound+One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane+However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried+A girl who heard a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red+The vision of an empty bed
The use of force, he was so tough+She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will+Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried+He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest+He's not the worst, he's not the best
And still this ceaseless murmuring+The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised+The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse+A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run+As he fades into the setting sun
I have always been here+I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime+Feels like more than a lifetime
Sometimes I get tired of the waiting+Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way it's always been?+Could it ever have been different?
Do you ever get tired of the waiting?+Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever+Nobody lives forever
I will always be in here+I will always look out from behind these eyes+It's only a lifetime+It's only a lifetime+It's only a lifetime
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land+Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers+But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise+In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed+It's not enough, it's not enough
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright+His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth+His step has faltered
One world, one soul+Time pass, the river rolls
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication+And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea+A grim intimation of what is to be
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night+And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words+Of promises broken
As you look around this room tonight+Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears+What do you want+What do you want from me?
Should I sing until I can't sing any more+Play these strings until my fingers are raw
You're so hard to please+What do you want from me?
Do you think that I know something you don't know+What do you want from me?
If I don't promise you the answers would you go+What do you want from me?
Should I stand out in the rain+Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?
I'm not the one you need  /What do you want from me?
You can have anything you want+You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water+Anything you want
You can own everything you see+Sell your soul for complete control+Is that really what you need?
You can lose yourself this night+See inside there is nothing to hide+Turn and face the light
What do you want from me?
Did you know...it was all going to go so wrong for you+And did you see it was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then+You were always the golden boy then+And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes
Hey you...did you ever realize what you'd become+And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes
The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty+I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know...+I never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes
On the day the wall came down+They threw the locks onto the ground+And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down+The Ship of Fools had finally ran aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight
I dreamed you had left my side+No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me+It was clear that I could not do a thing for you
Now life devalues day by day+As friends and neighbors turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands+While nations wash their bloodied hands+Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey
I woke to the sound of drums+The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you+And all but the bitter residues slipped away...slipped away
From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn't recognize I'd become+No more than alive I'd barely survive+In a word... overrun
Won't hear a sound (He's curled into the corner)+From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I've spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)+On the inside out (Curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)+To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart's (Waiting for the waves to break)+Not beating much
I murmured a vow of silence and now+I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night+Wear its darkness with an empty smile
I'm creeping back to life+My nervous system all awry+I'm wearing the inside out
Look at him now+He's paler somehow+But he's coming round
He's starting to choke+It's been so long since he spoke+Well he can have the words right from my mouth
And with these words I can see+Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name+Now we can hear ourselves again
I'm holding out (He's standing on the threshold)+For the day (Caught in fiery anger)+When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he'll)+Have blown away (Curse the place)
I'm with you now (He's torn in all directions)+Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)+Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)+Ourselves again
Her love rains down on me as easy as the breeze+I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire+We were spinning into darkness the earth was on fire
She could take it back, she might take it back some day
So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep+Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take+And I push her to the limit to see if she will break
Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides+It's easy to ignore them and God knows I've tried
All of this temptation, it turned my faith to lies+Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide
She can take it back, she will take it back some day+She can take it back, she will take it back some day+She can take it back, she will take it back some day
Where were you when I was burned and broken+While the days slipped by from my window watching
And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless+Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words+Dying to believe in what you heard+I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time+While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow+While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence+I knew the moment had arrived+For killing the past and coming back to life
I took a heavenly ride through our silence+I knew the waiting had begun+And headed straight... into the shining sun
For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals+Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination+We learned to talk
There's a silence surrounding me+I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner+No one can bother me
I think I should speak now+I can't seem to speak now
My words won't come out right+I feel like I'm drowning
I'm feeling weak now+But I can't show my weakness
I sometimes wonder+Where do we go from here
It doesn't have to be like this+All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
Why won't you talk to me?+You never talk to me?
What are you thinking?+What are you feeling?
What are you thinking?+Where do we go from here?
It doesn't have to be like this+All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
I feel like I'm drowning+You know I can't breathe now+We're going nowhere+We're going nowhere
I was spending my time in the doldrums+I was caught in the cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralyzed+I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies+Engulfed in a fever of spite+Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades+Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution+Is not going to help at all
Because there'll be no safety in numbers+When the Right One walks out of the door
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?+Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation+While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies+And I ask could we wipe the slate clean+But they tell me to please go fuck myself+You know you just can't win
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young+In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary+The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway,+Do they still meet there by the Cut?
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps+Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground+To a life consumed by slow decay
The grass was greener+The light was brighter+With friends surrounded+The nights of wonder
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us+To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again+Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled+We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition+There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon+Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener+The light was brighter+The taste was sweeter+The nights of wonder+With friends surrounded+The dawn mist glowing+The water flowing+The endless river++Forever and ever
Speech has allowed the communication of ideas+Enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future+With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
We bitch and we fight+Diss each other on sight+But this thing we do
These times together+Rain or shine or stormy weather+This thing we do
With world-weary grace+We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire+Felled by desire+Stoking the flame
But we're here for the ride
It's Louder than words this thing that we do+Louder than words – the way it unfurls
It's louder than words – the sum of our parts+The beat of our hearts is louder than words+Louder than words
The strings bend and slide as the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues, gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow+Wherever it goes+We're more than alive
Louder than words – this thing they call soul+It's there with a pulse louder than words+Louder than words
